# ADS-B Decoder Simulation

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a simulation of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) decoder. The simulation is designed to demonstrate the functionality of an ADS-B decoder, which is used in aviation to track aircraft in real-time and allows users to test and validate their implementation of the ADS-B decoder. 

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code in this repository:
- Python 3.x
- pyModeS
- PyQt5

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
